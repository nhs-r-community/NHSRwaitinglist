\title{Target Capacity}
\usage{
calc_target_capacity(
  demand,
  target_wait,
  factor = 4,
  cv_demand = 1,
  cv_capacity = 1,
  num_referrals = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{demand}{Numeric value of rate of demand in same units as target wait
e.g. if target wait is weeks, then demand in units of patients/week.}

\item{target_wait}{Numeric value of number of weeks that has been set as the
target within which the patient should be seen.}

\item{factor}{the amount we divide the target by in the waiting list
e.g. if target is 52 weeks the mean wait should be 13 for a factor of 4}

\item{cv_demand}{coefficient of variation of time between arrivals}

\item{cv_capacity}{coefficient of variation between removals due to
operations completed}
}
\value{
numeric. The capacity required to achieve a target waiting time.
}
\description{
Applies Kingman/Marchal's Formula :

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{ capacity = demand + (cvd**2 + cvc**2) / waiting_time
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

where
cvd           = coefficent of variation of time between arrivals
cvd           = coefficient of variation of sevice times
waiting_time  = target_wait / factor
}
\examples{

demand <- 4 # weeks
target_wait <- 52 # weeks

# number of operations per week to have mean wait of 52/4
calc_target_capacity(demand, target_wait)

# TODO: Include a couple of standard deviations for errors in the mean demand
}
