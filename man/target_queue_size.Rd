\title{Calculate Target Queue Size}
\usage{
target_queue_size(demand, target_wait, factor = 4)
}
\arguments{
\item{demand}{Numeric value of rate of demand in same units as target wait -
e.g. if target wait is weeks, then demand in units of patients/week.}

\item{target_wait}{Numeric value of number of weeks that has been set as the
target within which the patient should be seen.}

\item{factor}{Numeric factor used in average wait calculation - to get a
quarter of the target use factor=4 and one sixth of the target use factor =
6 etc. Defaults to 4.}
}
\value{
Numeric target queue length.
}
\description{
Uses Little's Law to calculate the target queue size to achieve
a target waiting time as a function of observed demand, target wait and a
variability factor used in the target mean waiting time calculation.

Target Queue Size = Demand * Target Wait / 4.

The average wait should sit somewhere between target_wait/factor=6 <
Average Waiting Time < target_wait/factor=4 The factor defaults to 4.

Only applicable when Capacity > Demand.
}
\examples{
# If demand is 30 patients per week and the target wait is 52 weeks, then the
# Target queue size = 30 * 52 / 4 = 390 patients.
target_queue_size(30, 52, 4)
}
