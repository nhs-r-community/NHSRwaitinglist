\title{Calculate Target Capacity}
\usage{
target_capacity(demand, target_wait, F = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{demand}{Numeric value of rate of demand in same units as target wait -
e.g. if target wait is weeks, then demand in units of patients/week.}

\item{target_wait}{Numeric value of number of weeks that has been set as the
target within which the patient should be seen.}

\item{F}{Variability coefficient, F = V/C * (D/C)^2 where C is the current
number of operations per week; V is the current variance in the number of
operations per week; D is the observed demand. Defaults to 1.}
}
\value{
A numeric value of target capacity required to achieve a target
waiting time.
}
\description{
Calculates the target capacity to achieve a given target waiting
time as a function of observed demand, target waiting time and a variability
coefficient F.

Target Capacity = Demand + 2 * ( 1 + 4 * F ) / Target Wait F defaults to 1.
}
\examples{

# If the target wait is 52 weeks, demand is 30 patients per week and F = 3
# then Target capacity = 30 + 2 * (1 + 4 * 3)/52 = 30.5 patients per week.
target_capacity(30,52,3)
}
