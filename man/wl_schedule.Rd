\title{A simple operation scheduler}
\usage{
wl_schedule(waiting_list, schedule, referral_index = 1, removal_index = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{waiting_list}{dataframe. A df of referral dates and removals}

\item{schedule}{vector of dates. The dates to schedule open referrals into
(ie. dates of unbooked future capacity)}

\item{referral_index}{integer. The column number in the waiting_list which
contains the referral dates}

\item{removal_index}{integer. The column number in the waiting_list which
contains the removal dates}
}
\value{
dataframe. A df of the updated waiting list with removal dates added
according to the schedule
}
\description{
Takes a list of dates and schedules them to a waiting list,
by adding a removal date to the dataframe.
This is done in referral date order,
I.e. earlier referrals are scheduled first (FIFO).
}
\examples{
referrals <- c.Date("2024-01-01", "2024-01-04", "2024-01-10", "2024-01-16")
removals <- c.Date("2024-01-08", NA, NA, NA)
waiting_list <- data.frame("referral" = referrals, "removal" = removals)
schedule <- c.Date("2024-01-03", "2024-01-05", "2024-01-18")
updated_waiting_list <- wl_schedule(waiting_list, schedule)
