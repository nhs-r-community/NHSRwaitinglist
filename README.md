### Pull-Request workflow

You are welcome to also submit Pull Requests and, as the `main` branch is protected and won't accept pushes directly even if you have been added to the repository as a member, the workflow will be (from your own forked repository if you are not a member, or a clone of the repository if you are a member):

* Create new branch with a descriptive name
* Commit to the new branch (add code or delete code or make changes)
* Push the commits 
* Create a pull-request in GitHub to signal that your work is ready to be merged
* Tag one or more reviewers (@ThomUK and @ChrisMainey) so that your contribution can be reviewed and merged into main
