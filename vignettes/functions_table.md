  |            `calc_queue_load()` | To understand the ratio between demand and capacity.                                                                  |
  |          `calc_target_mean_wait()` | To understand the average waiting time for a queue in equilibrium.                                                    |
  |     `calc_target_queue_size()` | To understand the queue size for a queue in equilibrium.                                                              |
  |       `calc_relief_capacity()` | To calculate the relief capacity needed to bring a very large queue under control.                                    |
  |       `calc_target_capacity()` | To understand the capacity required to keep a queue in equilibrium, depending on how much variability it experiences. |
  | `waiting_list_pressure()` | A pressure measure, which can be used to compare multiple waiting lists for planning purposes.                        |
