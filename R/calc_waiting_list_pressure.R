#' @title Calculate Waiting List Pressure
#'
#' @description For a waiting list with target waiting time, the pressure on the
#'   waiting list is twice the mean delay divided by the waiting list target.
#'   The pressure of any given waiting list should be less than 1. If the
#'   pressure is greater than 1 then the waiting list is most likely going to
#'   miss its target. The waiting list pressure is calculated as follows:
#'   pressure = 2 * mean_wait / target_wait.
#'
#' @param mean_wait Numeric value of target mean waiting time to achieve a given
#'   target wait.
#' @param target_wait Numeric value of the number of weeks that has been set as
#'   the target within which the patient should be seen.
#'
#' @return Numeric value of wait_pressure which is the waiting list pressure.
